# MARIO-KABOOM.JS
Aina Kubow's Mario Bros Game in JavaScript with kaboom.js

The video lesson could be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nucjefSr6I

Ania's GitHub repo for the lesson is here https://github.com/kubowania/mario

I just followed the video lesson and entered the code in VSCode by myself to see how it goes and to learn.

All the credits go to Ania Kubow!
